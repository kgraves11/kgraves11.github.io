<h1> CHAMPAIGN/URBANA BABYSITTER & PARENT CONNECTION <H1>
	<p> It Is so hard finding affordable babysitters nowadays so I decided to create a spot just for parents to be able to virtually visit, to locate affordable babysitters in their towns. I know absolutely nothing about the babysitters listed so please be advised to DO YOUR RESEARCH AND BACKGROUND CHECKS, or whatever security check you feel is necessary to make sure your children are safe and sent to a good babysitter.</h2>

<h2> This site is ONLY(nothing more) for sitters that are charging the daily rates set by the state of Illinois because those rates are set at pretty affordable rates that most people can afford to pay even if they are not receiving any government assistance</h2>

<h2> Parents and Gaurdians have no other choice but to work to provide for their families so there should be no reason in the world why parents have to pay websites just to be able to access a list and contact affordable local babysitters.</h2>
	<p> Because everything is already hard enough on parents all information is free and open for parents to be able to have easy access to fining the babysitter that they need</p>
